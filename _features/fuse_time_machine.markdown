All system status data (components, performance, threads usage, …) are correlated and can be visualized at any point in time. By using the Time-Machine feature administrators can “go back in time” and navigate into all Fuse Management Central interfaces as if they were on that specific moment in time, allowing to quickly pinpoint issues and drill-down into metric details.
